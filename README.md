# Modeling Risk Repository --- Ongoing 

<br>

**Introduction**

Welcome to the Modeling Risk repository! This project is an ongoing exploration into the multifaceted aspects of financial risk, encompassing market, credit, and operational risks. Our goal is to integrate fundamental and technical analysis to aid in asset purchasing, portfolio rebalancing, and overall asset improvement strategies.

<br>

**Project Overview**

In this repository, I delve into three main directions:

<br>

*Market Risk Analysis:* Assessing the volatility and potential loss in markets, focusing on factors that lead to market risk and methods to mitigate it.

*Credit Risk Evaluation:* Analyzing the likelihood of a default on credit and developing strategies to manage the risk associated with lending.

*Operational Risk Management:* Understanding and managing risks arising from internal processes, people, and systems, or external events.

<br>

The project aims to use a combination of fundamental and technical analysis to provide insights for asset purchasing and portfolio management.

**Repository Structure**

Notebooks: Contains Jupyter notebooks with detailed code, analysis, and visualizations. Each notebook includes comprehensive explanations and is designed to be self-contained with insights and conclusions.

Data: This folder includes sample datasets used in our analysis. Note that due to confidentiality and data size, some datasets are not publicly available.

Scripts: Utility scripts used for data processing, risk modeling, and other computational tasks.

Documentation: Additional documentation and resources relevant to the project.

**Ongoing Work**

This repository is actively maintained, and new content and updates are continuously being added. The notebooks are particularly dynamic, with regular updates to include the latest research findings, methodologies, and data analyses.
